Thanks to an impressive amount of interest for the service and to several
people stepping up to take it over, Libravatar will no longer be shutting
down in September as previously [announced on this
blog](https://blog.libravatar.org/posts/Libravatar.org_is_shutting_down_on_2018-09-01/).

Instead, it will transition to a new codebase and infrastructure in the
coming months. The details of the transition are still being finalize, but
if you have website site or application using Libravatar, there should be
no downtime or perceptible changes in the service. No changes will be
needed on your side.

Big thanks to clime, ij, kumy, nipos, ofalk, sumpfralle and tleguern who
attended the first [IRC meeting](https://wiki.libravatar.org/shutdown-coordination/#index2h2)
and who are working hard to modernize the codebase and take this service
to the next level.

If you want to get involved, come to the next [IRC
meeting](https://wiki.libravatar.org/shutdown-coordination/#index2h1) and
join our [mailing list](https://launchpad.net/~libravatar-fans) / IRC
channel (`#libravatar` on `irc.freenode.net`).
