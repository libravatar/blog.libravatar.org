The Libravatar project is happy to welcome
[Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com) as the new infrastructure sponsor of
the project. Thanks to their generosity, we have just
[moved](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/server-migration-plan/) to a new
server and will continue to run a free instance of the Libravatar
[server software](http://wiki.libravatar.org/running_your_own/).

In particular, thank you to Jesse Noller who made this possible and to the
customer service representative who made this experience extremely
painless. (Yes, you get to talk to a real human being when you activate a
Rackspace account!)

We would also like to take this opportunity to give our most sincere thanks
to [Andy Chilton](http://chilts.org) of [AppsAttic](http://appsattic.com/)
who has provided us with hosting for the past year and a half. It is only
with the generous support of people like Andy that we are able to operate
this service.

Finally, we are extremely grateful for the people
([Christian](http://cweiske.de/), [Melissa](http://meldraweb.com/) and
[Kai](http://hendry.iki.fi/)) who have volunteered to run
[mirrors](http://wiki.libravatar.org/run_a_mirror/) in the Libravatar
network. If you are keen to join them, please
[get in touch](http://wiki.libravatar.org/talk_to_us/)!
