The Libravatar project has been pretty active in the last few weeks. Other than a whole lot of [bug fixes](https://bugs.launchpad.net/libravatar/+bugs?field.searchtext=&orderby=-importance&search=Search&field.status%3Alist=FIXRELEASED&field.assignee=&field.bug_reporter=&field.omit_dupes=on&field.has_patch=&field.has_no_package=), the most important feature that got implemented in the last month is support for [BrowserID](https://browserid.org/), a new distributed and privacy-protecting authentication mechanism developed by [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org). Libravatar users can now use their BrowserID-verified email addresses to [login](https://www.libravatar.org/account/login/) automatically or to [add a new email address](https://www.libravatar.org/account/add_email/) to their account without having to go through manual email verification.

Other than that, we've been busy writing [new libraries](http://wiki.libravatar.org/libraries/) so that you can now add support for Libravatar in your [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/) applications. So if you are an asynchronous programming fan, you can now put human faces on your websites!

Talking about humans, you can now see the list of people behind Libravatar by taking a look at our very own [humans.txt](https://www.libravatar.org/humans.txt) file. Want to see your name in there? We love to welcome [new contributors](http://wiki.libravatar.org/contribute/)!
